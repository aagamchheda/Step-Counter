# Step-Counter
ISM330dhcx based and LPMS-B2
So this is my whole research idea and concept.
Step1:Took data from sensors (took data in count of 10 steps and lying and running, have shared some of my data as sample data to work on)
Step2:labelling data as the task you are doing
Step3: As the data is has a lot of noise it needs filtering.

There are 3 basic main programs anyone can use:
1. Basicadataplot-Has just a basic plotter code of data
2. Filteringdata-This will help with filtering the noise 
3. labelling data-This will help to label different type of data in the graph
For this I used ISM330dhcx sensor.

Then we worked on the LPMS-B2 sensor using openzenAPI.
So the:
accel.py
LPMS-B2 sensor.py
openzen.py
are related LPMS-B2 code.
